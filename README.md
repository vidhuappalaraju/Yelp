# Project 3 - *Yelp*

**Yelp** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height. (3pt)
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints. (+5pt)
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does). (+2pt)

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

- [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results. (+3pt)
- [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results. (+3pt)
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page. (+2pt)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Kind of curious about what are better designs to the Yelp application. 
2. How to implement maps with the Yelp application.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

I enjoyed learning about autolayout through this assignment. I thought it was cool making the Yelp the page considering it's an application used by many people. I hope we get to use other applications in a similar sense in the future too.
